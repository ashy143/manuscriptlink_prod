                        "And withal it is very simple, David.  The earth was once a nebulous mass.  It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank.  At length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface&mdash;a sort of shell; but within it was partially molten matter and highly expanded gases

                <div class="col-md-7">
                    <p>
                        As it continued to cool, what happened?  Centrifugal force burled the particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state.  You have seen the same principle practically applied in the modern cream separator.  Presently there was only a small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction of the cooling gases.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe.  What remains of it is the sun you saw today&mdash;a relatively tiny thing at the exact center of the earth.  Equally to every part of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light and torrid heat.

                        <p>Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</p>

                        <p>I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.</p>

So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.</p>
